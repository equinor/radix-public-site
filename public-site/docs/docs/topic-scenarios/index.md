# Scenarios

On this page you will find scenarios describing different app structures.  
For each scenario you can find example code for at least one programming language. The code is meant to give you an idea of how your project should look when deploying it to the radix platform. The examples is also a way for you to try out the platform, simply [clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) or copy the code to your own repository and follow [these guide on how to configure an app](/docs/start/config-your-app/).

&gt; **If there are no examples for your programming language:** Note that the main difference between all the examples is in the `radixconfig.yaml` and `Dockerfile`s, so you might still find these files and the project structures useful

## Authentication with AD

App which authenticates the user in AD, if logged in read basic user information from AD.
