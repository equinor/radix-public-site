## Getting access

Access to Radix is managed in Access IT. To get started, decide if you want to try the Playground cluster or go straight to the Radix Platform cluster. You will have access to register, build, deploy and maintain applications in that cluster.

- :circus_tent: Playground cluster: request the role "[Radix Playground Users](https://accessit.equinor.com/Search/Search?term=Radix+Playground+Users+%28OMNIA+RADIX%29)"

- :100: Radix Platform clusters: request the role "[Radix Platform Users](https://accessit.equinor.com/Search/Search?term=Radix+Platform+Users+%28OMNIA+RADIX%29)"

You can register your app in Playground first, and then again in Platform; there is no special "migrate to platform" process. If you have questions, [speak with us on Slack](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CBKM6N2JY) and we'll help.
