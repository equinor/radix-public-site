# Workload Identity

Some workloads (component or job replicas) running in Radix require credentials (JWT access tokens) for an **Azure AD app registration** or **user-assigned managed identity** to access Azure AD protected resources, like MS Graph, Key Vaults, Storage Accounts or Azure SQL Databases. Credentials for such workloads can be acquired using the [Oauth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow). The **client credentials flow** permits a workload to use its own credentials to access protected resources instead of impersonating a user. Credentials can be acquired by using either a shared secret, a certificate or with [federated credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#third-case-access-token-request-with-a-federated-credential).

Using shared secrets or certificates pose a security risk as they have to be stored securely and rotated regularly. With **federated credentials**, a trust between the [workload identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation) and an **Azure AD app registration** or **user-assigned managed identity** is established. The **workload identity** is a JSON Web Token (JWT) mounted as a file inside the workload's container. The JWT has a short liftime (one hour) and is automatically rotated.

## Configure workload identity in Radix

**Workload identity** for a component or job is configured in the [identity](../../references/reference-radix-config/#identity) section in [radixconfig.yaml](../../references/reference-radix-config/).  
The value of `clientId` is either the *Application (client) ID* for an Azure AD app registration or the *Client ID* for a user-assigned managed identity. Read the Azure documentation on how to create an [Azure AD app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm) or [user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

```yaml
apiVersion: radix.equinor.com/v1
kind: RadixApplication
metadata:
  name: my-radix-app
spec:
  environments:
    - name: prod
    - name: dev
  components:
    - name: web
      identity:
        azure:
          clientId: b96d264b-7053-4465-a4a7-32be5b0fec49 # Example value only, must be changed
  ...
```

Information required for setting up the trust relationship between a workload and the **Azure AD app registration** or **user-assigned managed identity** is available in the component/job page in Radix Web Console.
![Federation Trust Information](./identity-web-console.png "Federation Trust Information")  

## Configure trust relationship in Azure

Create a trust relationship (federated credential) between the workload (component or job) running in Radix and the app registration or user-assigned managed identity in Azure. A trust must be created per environment and workload. In the example above there are two environments (**prod** and **dev**) and one workload (**web**). Two trust relationships need to be created; one for **web** in **dev** environment and one for **web** in **prod** environment.

To create a trust relationship, open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the *Azure AD app registration* or *user-assigned managed identity* configured in `clientId` and open the *Federated credentials* page.

For *Azure AD app registration*, the page is located in *Certificates & secrets*
![Azure AD Application Federated Credentials](./azure-ad-app-federation.png "Azure AD Application Federated Credentials")  

For *user-assigned managed identities*, the page is located in *Federated credentials*
![Managed Identity Federated Credentials](./managed-identity-federation.png "Managed Identity Federated Credentials")  

Click **Add Credential** and select **Kubernetes accessing Azure resources** in the drop-down. Fill out the required fields **Cluster Issuer URL**, **Namespace** and **Service Account** with information from the component/job page in Radix Web Console. Enter a value in the **Name** field that uniquely describes the federated credential, e.g. *my-radix-app_dev_web*. Click **Add** to save the changes.

## Acquire credentials to access protected Azure resources

When workload identity is configured for a component or job, the following environment variables are set in the running container:

- **AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE** - path to the file containing the workload identity JWT (e.g. `/var/run/secrets/azure/tokens/azure-identity-token`)
- **AZURE_CLIENT_ID** - the value of `clientId` in the `identity` configuration section (e.g. `b96d264b-7053-4465-a4a7-32be5b0fec49`)
- **AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST** - The base URL to Azure identity provider (`https://login.microsoftonline.com/`)
- **AZURE_TENANT_ID** - The tenant ID to use when aquiring tokens from the Azure identity provider (e.g. *`3aa4a235-b6e2-48d5-9195-7fcf05b459b0`)

The file defined by **AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE** contains the JWT which identifies the current workload, and is used as the **client_assertion** value when requesting access tokens for Azure resources using the [OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow with federated credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#third-case-access-token-request-with-a-federated-credential).

It is recommended to use a SDK/library (see [SDKs and examples](./#sdks-and-examples)), like the [Azure SDK](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/topics/language-specific-examples/azure-identity-sdk.html), to handle the client credentials flow.

## SDKs and examples

- [Azure SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/): Programmatically manage and interact with Azure services with built in support for workload identity federation. See examples [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/topics/language-specific-examples/azure-identity-sdk.html).

- [MSAL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview): Acquire access tokens from the Microsoft identity platform. See examples [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/topics/language-specific-examples/msal.html).

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/): Interact with Azure services from the command line. Supports login with workload identity federation:

```bash
# Login
az login --service-principal -u $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --tenant $AZURE_TENANT_ID --federated-token $(cat $AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE) --allow-no-subscriptions

# Read a secret from a key vault that the logged on service principal has access to
MYSECRET=$(az keyvault secret show -n mysecret --vault-name mykeyvault --query value -o tsv)
```

- [curl](https://curl.se/): Send HTTP requests to the Microsoft identity platform to acquire access tokens:

```bash
curl ${AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST}${AZURE_TENANT_ID}/oauth2/v2.0/token \
  -X POST \
  -d "scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default
    &client_id=${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    &client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
    &client_assertion=$(cat $AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE)
    &grant_type=client_credentials"
```

Response:

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 86399,
    "ext_expires_in": 86399,
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6Ik{a lot of characters here}"
}
```
