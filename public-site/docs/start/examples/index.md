# Examples

This site is running as a Radix application, configured with its [radixconfig.yaml](https://github.com/equinor/radix-public-site/tree/main/radixconfig.yaml) file.

There are also two sample projects you can look at in the same repository:

- [examples/radix-example-oauth-proxy](https://github.com/equinor/radix-public-site/tree/main/examples/radix-example-oauth-proxy)
- [examples/radix-example-keda-servicebus](https://github.com/equinor/radix-public-site/tree/main/examples/radix-example-keda-servicebus)

There also exists _many_ Radix Applications on Github. [Find them here](https://github.com/search?q=path%3A**%2Fradixconfig.yaml&type=code).
