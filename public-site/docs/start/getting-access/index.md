title: Getting access
---

Access to Radix is managed through **Access IT**.  
To get started, decide whether you want to experiment in the **Playground cluster** or go directly to one of the **Platform clusters**.  

### :circus_tent: Playground Cluster

Request access by applying for the role [**Radix Playground Users**](https://accessit.equinor.com/Search/Search?term=Radix+Playground+Users+%28OMNIA+RADIX%29)

### :100: Platform Clusters

Search for [**Radix Platform Users**](https://accessit.equinor.com/Search/Search?term=Radix+Platform+Users+%28OMNIA+RADIX%29) and choose one of the following options:  

:::info Account types
**Standard Entra ID account**: This is your regular company user account (often used for email, Teams, etc.).

**AZ account (Adminkey/AZ-key)**: This is a privileged account (sometimes called "admin key" or "AZ-key") used for administrative or elevated access. You may have an AZ account if your role requires additional permissions.

If you are unsure which to use, most users should select the standard Entra ID account. Use your AZ account only if you have one and require elevated access.
:::
- **Radix Platform Users** → Access with your standard Entra ID account  
- **Radix Platform Users with Adminkey (AZ-key)** → Access with your AZ account  

### After Access is Approved

You can connect to the clusters using:  
- **Radix Web Console**  
- [**Radix CLI**](../../docs/topic-radix-cli/)  
- **Radix API**  

You may register your app in the Playground first and then again in the Platform cluster — there’s no dedicated “migration” process.
