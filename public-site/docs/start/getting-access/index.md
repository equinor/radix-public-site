title: Getting access
---

Access to Radix is managed through **Access IT**.  
To get started, decide whether you want to experiment in the **Playground cluster** or go directly to one of the **Platform clusters**.  

### :circus_tent: Playground Cluster

Request access by applying for the role [**Radix Playground Users**](https://accessit.equinor.com/Search/Search?term=Radix+Playground+Users+%28OMNIA+RADIX%29)

### :100: Platform Clusters

Search for [**Radix Platform Users**](https://accessit.equinor.com/Search/Search?term=Radix+Platform+Users+%28OMNIA+RADIX%29) and request the option(s) that suits you:  

- **Radix Platform Users** → Access with your standard Entra ID account  
- **Radix Platform Users with Adminkey (AZ-key)** → Access with your AZ account  

### After Access is Approved

You can connect to the clusters using:  
- **Radix Web Console**  
- [**Radix CLI**](../../docs/topic-radix-cli/)  
- **Radix API**  

You may register your app in the Playground first and then again in the Platform cluster — there’s no dedicated “migration” process.  

If you have questions, reach out on Slack: [#radix-support](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CBKM6N2JY) — we’re here to help.
