# The Radix clusters

Your application(s) will run in a *Kubernetes cluster*. Radix currently have three clusters: **Platform (North Europe)**, **Platform 2 (West Europe)** and **Playground**. Use Playground for testing Radix and see if it's a good fit for your needs. When your project and team are happy with Radix, you should register your application to one of the **Platform** clusters, which provides [specific guarantees](/docs/topic-uptime/).
