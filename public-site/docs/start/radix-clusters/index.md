Your application(s) will run in a *Kubernetes cluster*. Radix currently have two: **Radix Platform** and **Playground**. Use Playground for testing Radix and see if it's a good fit for your needs. When your project and team are happy with Radix, you should register your application in the Radix Platform cluster, which provides [specific guarantees](/docs/docs/topic-uptime/).

**Radix Platform** and **Playground** clusters are hosted on Azure North Europe region.
