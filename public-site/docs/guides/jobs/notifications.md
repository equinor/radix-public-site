## Notifications

When job and batch status needs to be monitored, their statuses can be [pulled](docs/guides/jobs/job-manager-and-job-api.md#get-a-state-of-a-batch). Another option is to use job component [notifications](/radix-config/index.md#notifications), posted to one of Radix application components.

The URL to the Radix application component or job component endpoint can be specified in the `webhook` option in the `notifications` section in the [radixconfig.yaml](/radix-config/index.md). This is an endpoint where a Radix batch events will be posted when any of the running jobs or batches for this job component changes states. Notification about changes are sent by a `POST` method with an `application/json` `ContentType` with a [Radix batch event format](#radix-batch-event), which extends the [Radix batch status](./job-manager-and-job-api.md#get-a-state-of-a-batch) format with fields
* `name` - internal name of the batch or a single job. In both cases the name begins with `batch-`
* `created`, `started`, `ended` - timestamp of corresponding batch live cycle event
* `status` - status of a batch or a single job
* `updated` - timestamp when a status was updated
* `event`:
  * `Create` - this event is sent when a new Radix batch or job is created.
  * `Update` - this event is sent when an existing Radix batch or one of its jobs, including single job, has changed state.
  * `Delete` - this event is sent when an existing Radix batch or job is deleted.
* `batchType`:
  * `job` - single job
  * `batch` - batch of jobs
* `jobStatuses` - list of statuses of only changed jobs. This list can be empty when the common properties are changed (e.g. only `started`, `status`). 

Fields in the `jobStatus` list items:
* `jobId` - optional name, specified for the job within `JobDescription`
* `batchName` - name of a batch for job in a batch. It is not provided for single jobs.
* `podStatuses` - list of status and attributes of one or several job pods (replicas). If the job's replica failed and job-component has [backoffLimit](/radix-config/index.md#backofflimit) greater then `0`, `podStatus` contains `exitCode` and `reason` for failed pods. `podIndex` gives an order of pod statuses (starting from `0`)
  * In the `podStatuses` replica attribute `image` should be the same for all pods, but `imageId` _can_ be different, if this image was updated within a period of different pods starts.


`notifications` and `webhook` can be specified on a job component configuration level and/or on `environmentConfig` level. Property in the `environmentConfig` will override those on the component level, if present.

:::tip
* Only a Radix application component or job component name and their ports can be used in the webhook URL
* Only private ports of the specified component can be used, public ports cannot be used for this purpose.
