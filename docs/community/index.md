# Community

Radix aims to be _the_ platform to build and deploy code within Equinor. It can only be that if it helps Equinor developers — that's you — succeed.

Of course, Radix is developed and maintained by Equinor developers as well. That means we want to work together to build the best platform we can. If you have problems or suggestions, we want to hear from you! It helps.

!!! tip "Hello"
    We are based in Forus Øst - A2 in Stavanger. If you see us on the corridor, say hello!

## On Slack

If you'd like to discuss the platform, features or improvements, head on to the main [Omnia Radix channel](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/C8U7XGGAJ). Stuck? App not building? Don't understand the docs? the place to ask is in [the support channel](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CBKM6N2JY).

Let us together build the Radix community!..

## On GitHub
