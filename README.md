# Radix Public Site

[![Logo](logo/Banner%20energy%20red@2x.png)](https://radix.equinor.com)  
radix.equinor.com (public site)  

This is the public site for promoting, documenting & showcasing the Radix
platform. It is a static site built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This page is rendered by both Docosarus at https://radix.equinor.com **and** by mkdocs at https://varia.equinor.com/docs/default/system/radix. Make sure it works nice in both by running `make docusaurus-serve` to test the Docosaurus build, and `make techdocs-serve` to test mkdocs. 

## Running, building

### The easy way

`make dev-up`: Starts Docker compose services beloning to the`dev` profile.

This starts the Docusaurus developer server on port 8000, and NGINX on port 8080 which proxies requests to the docusaurus server. This ensures that your browser receives the same security related headers (defined in ./proxy/headers) as when you build and run the Dockerfile container image. Changes to source files are immediatly shown in the browser.

You can see the site on &lt;http://localhost:8081&gt;

Stop the server with Ctrl+C, but also run `make dev-down` to clean up the
Docker state.

If you need a shell in the container:

    `docker exec -ti radix-public-site_container sh`

NB: The search plugin does not work when running the docusaurus development server.

You can also build and run the container image intended for production environments by running `make prod-up`. To stop and cleanup you run `make prod-down`.

### The other way

You can also run docusurus locally. All that is needed is NodeJS and NPM. In the root folder of the project run `npm i` to fetch dependencies followed by `npm run start` to start serving the development environment of the Public Site. The disadvantage is that you will not catch errors caused by the security headers set by NGINX.

## Files and folder structure

File `docusaurus.config.ts` contains the main configuration for Docusaurus. This is where we configure the overall page layout like headers, footers, navbar, themes etc. `sidebars.ts` contains configuration for the sidebars.

Documentation folder structure:

- `/community/`: Information about the Radix community and team. 
- `/docs/`: General concepts (topics).
- `/feature/`: List of all fratures in Radix.
- `/guides/`: User-friendly, conversational guides on how to achieve specific objectives.
- `/radix-config/`: Reference documentation for end-users.
- `/start/`: Getting started guide

NGINX configuration:

- `/proxy/server.conf`: Configuration used for production. Serves the statically built files.
- `/proxy/server.dev.conf`: Configuration used for development. Proxies requests to docusaurus backend.
- `/proxy/securityheaders`: Contains security related headers for the HTTP response. Included in both production and development configurations. The `Content-Security-Profile` value for `script-src` includes two sha256 values (`$script_src_dev_sha` when running in dev mode, and `$script_src_prod_sha` for production build) for inline javascript generated by docusaurs. These scripts can change when packages are updated, which will cause the sha256 values to be invalid, causing the web page to fail. In this happens the values for both variables must be updated. Chrome (and chromium based browsers) will print the expected value in `Developer Tools` > `Console`. Run `make dev-up` to get the value for `$script_src_dev_sha`, and `make prod-up` for `$script_src_prod_sha`. Update both variables with the new corresponding values and test that both dev and prod builds works by running `dev-up` and then `prod-up`. NB: There are two different sha256 values for the prod build: one on to main page, and one when navigating to sub-pages. You should do a full reload (Ctrl+F5) of both the main page and one of the sub-pages to get both hashes.
